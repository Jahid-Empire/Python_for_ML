# ML Learning Path - Python Module#
This repository contains my machine learning learning path codes in Python, including both advanced machine learning techniques and foundational Python basics. It serves as a revisiting and refining of my learning journey in the field of machine learning and Python programming.

About
The code in this repository reflects my continuous learning journey in the field of machine learning and Python basics. It includes algorithms, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and more, along with core Python programming concepts that form the foundation for implementing machine learning models.

Key Features:
Python Basics: Fundamental Python programming concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.
Functions: Creating and using functions to structure code efficiently.
Data Structures: Understanding and using common data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
File Handling: Reading from and writing to files using Python’s file handling techniques.
Error Handling: Using exceptions and try/except blocks to manage errors in code.
Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

basic_syntax/: Examples and exercises focusing on Python syntax and structure.
functions/: Code related to the creation and usage of functions in Python.
data_structures/: Implementations and exercises on Python’s built-in data structures.
file_handling/: Demonstrations of reading, writing, and managing files in Python.
error_handling/: Examples of error handling techniques using try, except, and custom exceptions.
